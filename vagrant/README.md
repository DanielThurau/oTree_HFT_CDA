## High Frequency Trading Vagrant Installation

These files provide a one-step installation method for testing high frequency trading. To use, download [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), then download and extract [vagrant.zip](vagrant/vagrant.zip). `cd` into the extracted vagrant folder and run `vagrant up`. Vagrant should download and configure everything needed to run the program, and after a few minutes you should see the program running at http://192.168.33.10:8000.
