hft_bcs
=================

oTree implementation of the High Frequency Trading Experiment using CDA.

Currently this project is in prototyping alpha phase. We are testing feasability of re-implementing HFT inside of oTree to handle managing users. 

Websocket-client will be used to communicate with the exchange server.

Django channels will be tested for integration as a means of RTC between the subjects and admin machine.
